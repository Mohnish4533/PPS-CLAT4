# PPS-CLAT4 Mini Project
Topic : ELab enhancement
Description: 
Teachers have troouble in a time consuming process of asking each student to show their progress on ELab. 
To improve this situation:
  Step 1: my program will need to take inputs from each student ELab about their progress.
  Step 2: Each teacher can code their own criteria for awarding marks.
  Step 3: Using the data obtained from ELab and the criteria mention by the teacher. It will calculate the marks obtained by each student. 

This makes the whole process easier and less time consuming for the teachers.

Current limitations:
1. Program does not take data directly from ELab. So manual test data needs to be provided


Additions planned for the future:
1. More options for criteria:
2. Checking each question:
    - getting details of each question
    - and then comparing with other students and identifying who did it with the least cyclomatic complexity and least tokens etc...
3. Leader in various categories like
    - Overall Leaderboard
    - weekly Leaderboard
4. Search option to find progress of indivisual student
5. Filter option to find people who have not completed the required number of programs
